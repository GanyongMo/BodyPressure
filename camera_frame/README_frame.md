## Hardware design for affixing the camera frame to the bedframe
First let's inspect how the camera frame is attached to the bed. It is fixed to the back of the headboard.

The camera frame is mounted to the bedframe at four locations as shown below:

</p>  
It is essential to fix these points securely to ensure safety of the frame. The top two mounts consist of through-holes that you will have to drill through the bed. The bottom two mounts are more tricky, and use 1/8'' thick aluminum plates to hook onto the steel buttons on the bed

## Construction of the base of the frame on the headboard of the bed

Building the bottom brace of the frame:

You will need to use machine shop tools to fabricate the 1/8'' thick aluminum plates. I was able to get away with using a drill press, a band saw, and a table mounted belt sander. The specification diagram for the left bracket is shown below. The right bracket mirrors the left one. Here are my recommendations for machining each bracket:
1. Cut out a rectangular piece of aluminum as large as the overall dimensions.
2.
